<p>An application of level 10 from ReactJS Mentee from BairesDev. The proposal is made an application that allows users to track what they have done and what they still need to complete.

This application has a two tabs user interface that is two routes either. One tab or route (Todo) displays the items still pending, and the other one (Done) shows the item marked as complete.

On the Todo pane, the application shows two controls: an input used to add new items to the Todo list, and a list of todo items. Each item on the Todo list has a checkbox that when activated, changes its style in todo list (adding a striking style and decrease the opacity) and adds it to the done list.

The Done pane, only displays a list of done items. Each item shows an icon that when clicked, removes the item from the done list and back to normal style in Todo list.

The state is controlled with **[Redux](https://redux.js.org/)** and **[Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)** wich is a simple and better approach to state management.  All project is made with **[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)** and using **[react hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)** in all components and pages.<p/>

You can access the application in **[https://todobairesdev.web.app/](https://todobairesdev.web.app/)**
